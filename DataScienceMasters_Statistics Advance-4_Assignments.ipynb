    "\n",
    "1. **Standard Deviation Known vs. Unknown:**\n",
    "   - **Z-Test:** Assumes that the population standard deviation $(\\sigma)$ is known.\n",
    "   - **t-Test:** Used when the population standard deviation $(\\sigma)$ is unknown and estimated from the sample $(s)$.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Sample Size:**\n",
    "   - **Z-Test:** Typically used for large sample sizes (usually $(n \\geq 30)$.\n",
    "   - **t-Test:** Suitable for smaller sample sizes, especially when $(n < 30)$, but it becomes robust for larger samples.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Distribution:**\n",
    "   - **Z-Test:** Assumes a normal distribution of the population or a large sample size due to the Central Limit Theorem.\n",
    "   - **t-Test:** More robust to deviations from normality, making it suitable for smaller samples.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Critical Values:**\n",
    "   - **Z-Test:** Critical values are obtained from the standard normal distribution.\n",
    "   - **t-Test:** Critical values depend on the degrees of freedom and are obtained from the t-distribution.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example Scenarios:**\n",
    "- **Z-Test:**\n",
    "  - *Scenario:* You are conducting a study on the average height of adults in a country where the population standard deviation of height is well-known. You collect a large sample (e.g., $(n \\geq 30)$ and want to test whether the average height of your sample differs significantly from the known population mean height.\n",
    "  - *Test Type:* Z-Test for One Sample Mean.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **t-Test:**\n",
    "  - *Scenario:* You are conducting a study on the effectiveness of a new drug on a small group of patients (e.g., $(n < 30)$. You collect data on the blood pressure of patients before and after treatment and want to test whether there is a significant difference in mean blood pressure.\n",
    "  - *Test Type:* Paired Sample t-Test.\n",
    "\n",
    "In summary, use a Z-test when the population standard deviation is known, and you have a large sample size. Use a t-test when the population standard deviation is unknown, or the sample size is small, and you need to estimate the standard deviation from the sample."

    "   - **Two-Tailed Test:** A statistical test in which the critical region is on both sides of the sampling distribution (both the right and left).\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Hypotheses:**\n",
    "   - **One-Tailed Test:** Involves a directional hypothesis, specifying the expected direction of the effect (e.g., greater than, less than).\n",
    "   - **Two-Tailed Test:** Involves a non-directional hypothesis, testing whether there is any significant difference without specifying the direction.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Critical Region:**\n",
    "   - **One-Tailed Test:** The critical region is located in one tail of the distribution.\n",
    "   - **Two-Tailed Test:** The critical region is divided between both tails of the distribution.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Alpha Level (Significance Level):**\n",
    "   - **One-Tailed Test:** The significance level (\\(\\alpha\\)) is typically divided by 2 (\\(\\alpha/2\\)), allocating half to each tail.\n",
    "   - **Two-Tailed Test:** The significance level (\\(\\alpha\\)) is used as is, split equally between the two tails.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Decision Rule:**\n",
    "   - **One-Tailed Test:** Reject the null hypothesis if the test statistic falls into the critical region in the specified direction.\n",
    "   - **Two-Tailed Test:** Reject the null hypothesis if the test statistic falls into either of the two critical regions.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **Example:**\n",
    "   - **One-Tailed Test:** Testing whether a new drug increases the average performance (one tail for \"greater than\").\n",
    "   - **Two-Tailed Test:** Testing whether a coin is biased (two tails for \"different from\").\n",
    "\n",
    "7. **Use Cases:**\n",
    "   - **One-Tailed Test:** When there is a specific directional hypothesis or when the focus is on detecting an effect in one direction.\n",
    "   - **Two-Tailed Test:** When there is no specific expectation about the direction of the effect or when interest lies in detecting any significant difference.\n",
    "\n",
    "In summary, the choice between a one-tailed and two-tailed test depends on the research question, the directional hypothesis, and the nature of the effect being investigated. One-tailed tests are more focused on a specific direction, while two-tailed tests are more inclusive, detecting differences in either direction."
