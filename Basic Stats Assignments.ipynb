    "* **Mean:** Outliers, particularly extreme values, can significantly pull the mean towards themselves, distorting the \"average\" representation of the data.\n",
    "* **Median:** Less affected by outliers as it focuses on the middle value. However, large outliers can still shift the median slightly.\n",
    "* **Mode:** Unaffected by outliers if they are not the most frequent value. However, if an outlier is the most frequent value, it becomes the mode, masking the true center of the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "**2. Measures of Dispersion:**\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Range:** Outliers increase the range, exaggerating the apparent spread of the data.\n",
    "* **Variance and Standard Deviation:** Outliers inflate the variance and standard deviation, making the data appear more dispersed than it actually is.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example:**\n",
    "\n",
    "Consider a dataset of exam scores: {70, 80, 80, 85, 90, 100}.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Central Tendency:**\n",
    "\n",
    "* Mean: 85\n",
    "* Median: 85\n",
    "* Mode: 80\n",
    "\n",
    "**Dispersion:**\n",
    "\n",
    "* Range: 30\n",
    "* Variance: 42.5\n",
    "* Standard Deviation: 6.5\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, introduce an outlier score of 30.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Central Tendency:**\n",
    "\n",
    "* Mean: 74.7\n",
    "* Median: 80\n",
    "* Mode: 80 (unchanged)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Dispersion:**\n",
    "\n",
    "* Range: 70\n",
    "* Variance: 192.25\n",
    "* Standard Deviation: 13.87\n",
    "\n",
    "As you can see, the outlier significantly affects the mean, range, variance, and standard deviation. The median and mode are less affected, but the outlier still influences their interpretation.\n",
    "\n",
    "This example highlights how outliers can distort the perception of data. Choosing appropriate measures and analyzing the data carefully is crucial to avoid misleading conclusions due to outliers.\n"
