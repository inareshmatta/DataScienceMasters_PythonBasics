    "Linear regression relies on several key assumptions to be valid. Here are the main assumptions of linear regression:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Linearity**: The relationship between the independent variables and the dependent variable should be linear. This means that the change in the dependent variable is proportional to the change in the independent variable(s).\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Independence of Errors**: The errors (residuals) should be independent of each other. In other words, the residuals should not be correlated with each other.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Homoscedasticity (Constant Variance of Residuals)**: The variance of the residuals should be constant across all levels of the independent variables. This implies that the spread of residuals should be uniform as the predicted values change.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Normality of Residuals**: The residuals should follow a normal distribution. This assumption is about the distribution of the errors, not the distribution of the dependent variable or the independent variables.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **No Perfect Multicollinearity**: There should be no perfect linear relationship between the independent variables. In other words, the independent variables should not be highly correlated with each other.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Checking Assumptions:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Residuals vs. Fitted Values Plot**: Plot the residuals against the fitted (predicted) values. This helps to assess linearity and identify potential outliers.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Residuals Autocorrelation Plot**: Check for autocorrelation in the residuals using a correlogram. Autocorrelation indicates that the assumption of independence of errors is violated.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Residuals vs. Predictor Variables Plot**: Plot the residuals against each independent variable to detect patterns or nonlinearity.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Histogram or Q-Q Plot of Residuals**: Examine the distribution of residuals to assess normality. Histograms and quantile-quantile (Q-Q) plots can help with this.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Variance Inflation Factor (VIF)**: Calculate the VIF for each independent variable to detect multicollinearity. VIF values above 10 indicate high multicollinearity.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **Durbin-Watson Statistic**: This tests for autocorrelation in the residuals. A value between 1 and 3 is generally acceptable, with values close to 2 indicating no autocorrelation.\n",
    "\n",
    "7. **Cook's Distance**: This measures the influence of each observation on the regression coefficients. High Cook's distances indicate influential outliers.\n",
    "\n",
    "By assessing these diagnostics and plots, you can gain insight into whether the assumptions of linear regression hold in your dataset. If the assumptions are violated, corrective actions may be needed, such as transforming variables, removing outliers, or considering alternative modeling techniques."

    "\n",
    "1. **Intercept $( \\beta_0 )$**: The intercept represents the predicted value of the dependent variable when the independent variable is zero. It is the value of $( Y )$ when $( X )$ equals zero. In some cases, the intercept may not have a meaningful interpretation, especially if the range of the independent variable does not include zero.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Slope $( \\beta_1 )$**: The slope represents the change in the dependent variable for a one-unit change in the independent variable. It indicates the rate of change in $( Y )$ with respect to changes in $( X )$. A positive slope suggests a positive relationship between $( X )$ and $( Y )$, while a negative slope suggests a negative relationship.\n",

    "**Example:**\n",
    "Let's consider a real-world scenario where we want to predict the price of houses based on their size (in square feet). We collect data on house sizes and their corresponding prices and fit a linear regression model.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Intercept**: The intercept represents the base price of a house with zero square feet. In reality, a house cannot have zero square feet, so the intercept might not have a direct interpretation in this context. It's often used to ensure that the line fits the data well.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Slope**: The slope represents the change in the house price for each additional square foot. For example, if the slope coefficient is $100, it means that, on average, each additional square foot increases the house price by $100.\n",
    "\n",
    "So, in this scenario, if the regression equation is $( \\text{Price} = 50000 + 100 \\times \\text{Size} )$, the interpretation would be that the base price of a house (without any square feet) is $50,000, and for every additional square foot, the price increases by $100.\n",

    "\n",
    "1. **Initialization**: The algorithm starts by initializing the model parameters (weights) with random values or zeros.\n",

    "3. **Compute the Gradient**: The gradient of the cost function with respect to each parameter (weight) is calculated. The gradient indicates the direction of the steepest increase of the cost function. To minimize the cost function, we need to move in the opposite direction of the gradient.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Update Parameters**: The parameters are updated iteratively using the gradient. The update rule is defined as follows:\n",
    "   $[ \\theta_{\\text{new}} = \\theta_{\\text{old}} - \\alpha \\cdot \\nabla J(\\theta_{\\text{old}}) ]$\n",

    "   - $( \\nabla J(\\theta_{\\text{old}}) )$ is the gradient of the cost function with respect to the parameters.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Repeat**: Steps 2 to 4 are repeated until the algorithm converges to the minimum of the cost function or reaches a predefined number of iterations.\n",

    "Gradient descent can have different variants based on how it updates the parameters and the amount of data it uses to compute the gradient (batch gradient descent, stochastic gradient descent, mini-batch gradient descent).\n",

In multiple linear regression, each coefficient represents the change in the dependent variable when the corresponding independent variable changes, holding all other variables constant.\n",

    "Multicollinearity in multiple linear regression occurs when two or more independent variables in the model are highly correlated with each other. This correlation can cause issues in the regression analysis, including unstable parameter estimates, inflated standard errors, and difficulty in interpreting the coefficients.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Effects of Multicollinearity:\n",
    "1. **Unstable Coefficients**: Multicollinearity can lead to unstable estimates of the coefficients. Small changes in the data can result in large changes in the estimated coefficients.\n",
    "2. **Inflated Standard Errors**: Multicollinearity inflates the standard errors of the coefficients, making the estimates less precise and reducing the statistical significance of the predictors.\n",

    "### Detection of Multicollinearity:\n",
    "1. **Correlation Matrix**: Calculate the correlation matrix between the independent variables. High correlation coefficients (close to ±1) indicate potential multicollinearity.\n",

    "1. **Variable Selection**: Remove one of the highly correlated variables from the model. Choose the variable that is less theoretically relevant or has a weaker correlation with the dependent variable.\n",
    "2. **Principal Component Analysis (PCA)**: PCA can be used to create orthogonal components that capture most of the variation in the data while avoiding multicollinearity.\n",
    "3. **Ridge Regression**: Ridge regression adds a penalty term to the regression coefficients, which reduces their magnitude and helps to stabilize the estimates in the presence of multicollinearity.\n",
    "4. **Combine Variables**: Create new variables by combining the highly correlated variables or use domain knowledge to create composite variables that capture the shared variation.\n",

    "Polynomial regression is a form of regression analysis in which the relationship between the independent variable $( x )$ and the dependent variable $( y )$ is modeled as an $( n )$-th degree polynomial. Unlike linear regression, which assumes a linear relationship between the independent and dependent variables, polynomial regression allows for more complex and nonlinear relationships to be captured.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Differences from Linear Regression:\n",
    "1. **Model Complexity**: In polynomial regression, the relationship between the independent and dependent variables is modeled using a polynomial function of degree $( n )$. This allows for more flexibility in capturing nonlinear patterns in the data compared to linear regression, which assumes a straight-line relationship.\n",
    "2. **Degree of the Polynomial**: In polynomial regression, the degree of the polynomial (i.e., the highest power of $( x )$ is a parameter that can be specified based on the complexity of the relationship being modeled. Higher-degree polynomials can capture more intricate patterns but may also be prone to overfitting.\n",
    "3. **Curve Fitting**: Polynomial regression fits a curve to the data, whereas linear regression fits a straight line. This allows polynomial regression to capture curvature and complex patterns that linear regression cannot.\n",
    "4. **Interpretability**: Polynomial regression models can be less interpretable than linear regression models, especially for higher-degree polynomials. Interpreting the coefficients of polynomial terms becomes more challenging as the degree of the polynomial increases.\n",
    "5. **Risk of Overfitting**: Polynomial regression models with high-degree polynomials are susceptible to overfitting, especially when the model captures noise in the data rather than the underlying patterns.\n",

    "Consider a scenario where we are modeling the relationship between the age of a car (in years) and its resale value (in dollars). While linear regression would assume a constant rate of depreciation over time (a straight line), polynomial regression could capture more nuanced patterns such as rapid depreciation in the early years followed by a slower decline.\n",

    "1. **Increased Model Complexity**: Polynomial regression models can become complex, especially with higher-degree polynomials. As the degree of the polynomial increases, the model may overfit the training data and generalize poorly to new data.\n",
    "2. **Interpretability Challenges**: Interpretation of polynomial regression models becomes more challenging as the degree of the polynomial increases. Coefficients of higher-order polynomial terms may not have straightforward interpretations.\n",
