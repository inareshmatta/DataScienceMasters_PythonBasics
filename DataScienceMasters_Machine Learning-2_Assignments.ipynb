    "Reducing overfitting is crucial for building machine learning models that generalize well to new, unseen data. Here are several strategies to mitigate overfitting:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Regularization:**\n",
    "   - Apply regularization techniques such as L1 or L2 regularization to penalize overly complex models. This adds a penalty term to the loss function based on the magnitude of model parameters, discouraging extreme values.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Cross-Validation:**\n",
    "   - Use techniques like k-fold cross-validation to assess model performance on multiple subsets of the data. This helps detect overfitting by evaluating how well the model generalizes to different data partitions.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Feature Selection:**\n",
    "   - Select and engineer features that are most relevant to the problem, avoiding irrelevant or noisy ones. Feature selection helps focus the model on the most informative aspects of the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Data Augmentation:**\n",
    "   - Augment the training data by generating new examples through transformations such as rotation, scaling, or cropping. Data augmentation helps expose the model to a more diverse set of examples, reducing the risk of overfitting.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Ensemble Methods:**\n",
    "   - Use ensemble methods like Random Forests or Gradient Boosting, which combine multiple models to improve overall performance. Ensemble methods help mitigate overfitting by reducing the impact of individual model idiosyncrasies.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **Early Stopping:**\n",
    "   - Monitor the model's performance on a validation set during training and stop when further training does not improve performance. Early stopping helps prevent the model from learning noise in the later stages of training.\n",
    "\n",
    "7. **Dropout:**\n",
    "   - Apply dropout regularization in neural networks by randomly dropping out units during training. This prevents the model from relying too much on specific neurons and encourages robustness.\n",
    "\n",
    "8. **Simpler Models:**\n",
    "   - Use simpler models with fewer parameters when the complexity of the data does not warrant a highly complex model. This helps avoid fitting noise in the training data.\n",
